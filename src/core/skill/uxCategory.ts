/**
 * Source-to-UX-category mapping.
 *
 * The Toolbox shows 4 top-level skill buckets (`SkillUXCategory`):
 *
 *   - **mine** — user/standard/project/project-standard. Everything
 *     the human (or their team's repo) explicitly put on disk.
 *   - **agent-evolved** — workspace-auto + draft. Everything Abu's
 *     self-evolution produced. Kept separate from `mine` so users
 *     can tell "I made this" from "Abu made this".
 *   - **third-party** — installed from a registry (CLAWhub, the
 *     internal SkillsHub, …). Empty in MVP; reserved for v0.14+.
 *   - **builtin** — bundled with the app binary.
 *
 * All Toolbox grouping goes through this function, so the enum-to-
 * bucket mapping stays in one place and it's hard to forget a new
 * source (unknown values log a warning instead of silently landing
 * in `mine`, which was the pre-refactor bug where workspace-auto
 * skills looked like user-created ones).
