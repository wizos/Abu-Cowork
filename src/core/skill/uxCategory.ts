/**
 * Source-to-UX-category mapping.
 *
 * The Toolbox shows 3 top-level skill buckets (`SkillUXCategory`):
 *
 *   - **mine** — user/standard/project/project-standard/workspace-auto.
 *     Everything the human or Abu created on behalf of the user. Abu-created
 *     skills get the per-row "自进化" badge via sourceBadge() so the origin
 *     is still visible without a separate category.
 *   - **agent-evolved** — draft only. Pending agent proposals awaiting
 *     user review. Shown via SkillDraftsPanel when draftsCount > 0.
 *   - **builtin** — bundled with the app binary.
 *
 * All Toolbox grouping goes through this function, so the enum-to-
 * bucket mapping stays in one place and it's hard to forget a new
 * source (unknown values log a warning instead of silently landing
 * in `mine`).
