## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Autonomous Agent** — More than chat: plans, invokes tools, reads/writes files, executes commands, and completes complex tasks end-to-end
- **Plan Mode** — For high-risk steps (delete / overwrite / send / install), Abu first presents a step-by-step plan and waits for you to click "Confirm & run"; only read-only ops run while awaiting approval
- **Interactive questions** — When Abu needs you to decide (pick an approach, provide a parameter), it pops an option card above the composer; single or multi-select, with an "Other" free-text row
- **Per-conversation settings** — Permission mode (Request Approval / Smart Review / Full Autonomy) and model can be switched per conversation without bleeding across chats
- **Soul Personality System** — Three proactivity presets (Quiet / Buddy / Butler) decide when Abu speaks up; customize tone, address, reply style, and boundaries via `SOUL.md`
- **Self-Evolving Skills** — After you run a multi-step complex flow, Abu proactively offers "want to crystallize this into a skill?" — one click drafts it, you review, you accept. Next time, just name the skill; no need to re-explain
- **Smart Notification System** — Menubar unread count / sidebar badge / system notification auto-routed; notices queued to inbox while you're in fullscreen / DnD, surfaced via badges once you're back; audit trail kept for 180 days
- **Projects** — Promote a workspace into a Project: conversations in the same direction auto-aggregate; each project gets its own default model, skill set, and MCP connectors
- **Multi-Agent Parallel Execution** — Run up to 5 background agents simultaneously, each executing tasks independently with real-time progress tracking
- **Desktop Pet** (Labs) — Transparent floating window; left-click opens main window, right-click menu, drag-to-edge dock; **activity tray** shows Abu's live status (working / awaiting approval / done) and lets you reply inline while it waits
- **Theme switching** — Light / dark / system, via Settings → Appearance
- **Labs** — In-progress features, off by default, opt-in, may change or be removed (currently hosting: Desktop Pet)
- **Conversation Sharing** — Export any conversation to JSON in one click; API keys and local paths are auto-redacted before sharing
- **28 Built-in Skills** — PDF/PPTX/DOCX/Excel generation, frontend design, canvas design, algorithmic art, Mermaid/SVG/infographics, Web Artifacts, Chrome automation (Abu-Browser), deep research, Agent self-reflection (reflect), workflow automation, and more — one-click install, fully customizable
- **MCP Protocol** — Connect to databases, search engines, GitHub, and other external services via Model Context Protocol
- **Browser Automation** — Built-in Browser Bridge + Chrome extension for web element interaction, form filling, screenshots, and JS execution
- **Computer Use** — Screenshot + mouse/keyboard control for desktop-level tasks, with sensitive app blocking, dangerous key interception, and a 5-minute session timeout
- **HTTP Fetch** — Built-in safety gateway: URL length cap, embedded credential blocking, cloud metadata endpoint blocking, 10 MB download limit, 60-second timeout — no more raw `curl` blind spots

### AI Services & Models

- **12+ Cloud Providers** — Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Bailian), Doubao (Volcengine), Moonshot, Zhipu GLM, MiniMax, SiliconFlow, Qiniu, OpenRouter, and more
- **Local Models** — Zero-config Ollama integration with automatic local model discovery
- **Custom Endpoints** — Connect any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible API
- **Provider Management** — Add, edit, delete, reorder providers with connection health checks and latency detection
- **Model Selector** — Switch models on-the-fly during conversations with capability badges (vision, tool use, web search, thinking, image generation, long context)
- **Favorites & History** — Star frequently used models, quickly switch between recent ones
- **Image Generation** — Built-in DALL-E 2 / DALL-E 3 support, plus any custom image-generation endpoint

### Web Search

- **Multiple Search Engines** — Bing, Brave, Tavily, SearXNG (self-hosted, no API key needed)
- **Independent Configuration** — Search engine settings decoupled from main AI service

### Automation & Triggers

- **Scheduled Tasks** — Cron-based scheduling (e.g., daily AI news digest at 9 AM); runs missed while the app was closed are replayed in time order on next launch
- **Trigger System** — Multiple event sources to automatically invoke agents:
  - **File Watcher** — Monitor file create/modify/delete events with glob patterns
  - **HTTP Webhook** — Auto-generated POST endpoints for external callbacks
  - **IM Messages** — Trigger tasks on specific incoming messages
  - **Cron Schedule** — Periodic execution on a time-based plan
- **Trigger Permission Model** — Four capability levels (read-only → safe tools → full access → custom whitelist) for fine-grained control

### IM Channel Integration

Turn Abu into your team bot — just @Abu in your chat:

- **Supported Platforms** — D-Chat, Feishu (Lark), DingTalk, WeCom, Slack
- **Session Management** — Auto-isolate conversations by user/group/thread, auto-archive on timeout, "continue last" recovery
- **Security Controls** — User allowlist, workspace path restrictions, capability level enforcement
- **Response Modes** — Mention-only or all-messages

### Memory & Context

- **Three-tier file-based memory (Memdir architecture)**:
  - **Personal Memory** — `~/.abu/memory/` multi-file directory, applies across all projects, auto-organized by topic with `MEMORY.md` index injected into the prompt
  - **Project Memory** — `~/.abu/projects/<workspace>/memory/` auto-isolated per workspace, each entry is a separate `.md` file for easy reading, search, and pruning
  - **Auto-migration** — Legacy `~/.abu/agents/abu/memory.md` and `{workspace}/.abu/MEMORY.md` are migrated automatically on startup
- **Project Rules** (hand-written):
  - `~/.abu/ABU.md` — User-level rules (cross-project)
  - `{workspace}/.abu/ABU.md` — Project-level rules
  - `{workspace}/.abu/rules/*.md` — Modular rules (loaded alphabetically, max 20 files)
- **Project Aggregation** — Promote a workspace into a Project to aggregate its conversations; older conversations auto-backfilled with `projectId` on startup. Each project can independently configure default model, skill set, and MCP connectors
- **Session Memory** — Large tool outputs automatically persisted to disk; compact summaries kept in-context to prevent context explosion
- **Persistent Todos** — Per-conversation `todo_write` plans persisted to disk and survive app restarts
- **Auto-Compaction** — Intelligently compresses long conversation history while preserving key context

### Security & Privacy

- **Three Permission Modes** — **Request Approval** (free read/write inside workspace; out-of-bounds writes and dangerous commands need confirmation; default) / **Smart Review** (out-of-bounds ops go to an AI reviewer: allow low-risk, block high-risk, ask only when unsure) / **Full Autonomy** (everything runs automatically except hard system red-lines); global default in Settings → Sandbox, also switchable per conversation via the chip above the composer
- **Content Safety Scan** — Scans agent-authored skills / memory entries to catch dangerous instructions, prompt injection, hardware commands, and 120+ other risk patterns
- **OS Sandbox** — macOS Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) / Windows PowerShell ConstrainedLanguage isolates shell command file access
- **Network Isolation** — Local proxy + domain whitelist + private-network toggle to control every outbound request
- **Path & Command Safety** — Sensitive directories (system folders, SSH keys, etc.) blocked by default; dangerous commands (`rm -rf /`, etc.) caught statically
- **Computer Use Safeguards** — 15+ blocked sensitive apps (Keychain, System Settings, WeChat, Slack, etc.), dangerous key interception (Cmd+Q, Cmd+Tab, Force Quit), session-level window hiding, 5-minute timeout
- **Encrypted API Key Storage** — Windows DPAPI / macOS AES-256-GCM with a hardware-UUID-derived key; keys are no longer written to localStorage in plaintext
- **Local-First** — Your data stays local, your API keys stay local — nothing goes through third-party servers
- **Cross-Platform** — Supports macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel) and Windows

### Diagnostics & Troubleshooting

- **One-Click Self-Check** — Settings → Diagnostic, runs through AI service connectivity, data & permissions, MCP, skills, network, app environment
- **Diagnostic Bundle Export** — When something breaks, package logs / config / version info in one click (API keys and paths auto-redacted) and send it to the maintainer
