## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PM-Shawn/Abu-Cowork/releases). For first-launch security prompts, see the [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide_EN.md).

### 2. Configure a Model

1. Open Abu and click the **settings icon** at the bottom left
2. Go to **"AI Services"**
3. Select your API provider (Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.)
4. Enter your API Key
5. Choose the model to use

### 3. Start Chatting

Return to the main screen and describe what you need in natural language. Abu will plan and execute the task automatically.

---

## Chat & Agent

Abu's core is the **autonomous Agent execution mode** — it's not a simple Q&A chatbot.

### Workflow

1. **Understand** — Abu analyzes your request
2. **Plan** — Breaks down the task into steps
3. **Execute** — Reads/writes files, runs commands, searches for information
4. **Iterate** — Adjusts strategy based on results
5. **Report** — Tells you what was done and what files were created

### Permission Prompts

Abu asks for your confirmation before sensitive operations:

- **Command execution** — Asks before running shell commands for the first time
- **File writes** — Shows the changes before creating or modifying files
- **Path access** — Requests authorization for sensitive directories

You can **Allow**, **Deny**, or set **Always Allow** for specific operations.

### Conversation Management

- The left sidebar shows all conversation history
- Click **"New Chat"** to start a fresh task
- Search and delete conversations as needed

---

## Workspace & Memory

Workspace and memory let Abu understand your project context and personal preferences without repeating yourself.

### Workspace

A workspace is the root directory Abu operates in. Once set, Abu can read and write files within it.

1. Click the **Workspace** area in the right panel
2. Select your project folder
3. Grant access permissions

Below the workspace, you'll see two entries: **Project Instructions** and **Project Memory**.

### Memdir Architecture

Starting in v0.9.x, Abu's memory uses a **file-based (Memdir) architecture**: each memory entry is a separate `.md` file named by topic, and a `MEMORY.md` index file in the same directory is automatically injected into every conversation as context.

> Legacy `~/.abu/agents/abu/memory.md` and `{workspace}/.abu/MEMORY.md` are migrated automatically the first time you launch the new version — no manual action needed.

#### 1. Personal Memory (cross-project)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Location** | Settings → Personal Memory (grouped by workspace) |
| **Storage** | `~/.abu/memory/` directory containing multiple `.md` files + a `MEMORY.md` index |
| **Scope** | Applies across all projects |
| **Who writes** | Abu accumulates automatically; you can also edit manually |
| **Content** | Your name, communication preferences, tools you use, etc. |

**Example**: When you say "Remember my name is Shawn", Abu writes a `user_name.md` file to the personal memory directory and adds an entry to `MEMORY.md`. She'll remember you in future conversations.

#### 2. Project Memory (per-workspace)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Location** | Settings → Personal Memory → workspace-grouped view |
| **Storage** | `~/.abu/projects/<workspace-key>/memory/` directory |
| **Scope** | Current workspace only |
| **Who writes** | Abu accumulates automatically; you can also edit manually |
| **Content** | Tech stack, recent decisions, gotchas, external resource pointers |

**New behavior**: Project memory now lives under your **home directory at `~/.abu/projects/`** (sub-folder per workspace path hash) instead of inside `{workspace}/.abu/MEMORY.md`. Benefits:

- Doesn't pollute your project directory or get accidentally committed to git
- Easier to sync across machines (just sync `~/.abu/projects/`)
- Long workspace paths are auto-truncated with a DJB2 hash to stay under filename length limits

#### 3. Project Instructions (hand-written rules)

Project instructions are rules **you write by hand** that Abu must follow. They have the highest priority.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Location 1** | `~/.abu/ABU.md` — User-level rules (cross-project) |
| **Location 2** | `{workspace}/.abu/ABU.md` — Project-level rules (current workspace only) |
| **Location 3** | `{workspace}/.abu/rules/*.md` — Modular rules (loaded alphabetically, max 20 files) |
| **Who writes** | You write manually |
| **Priority** | Highest — Abu follows these strictly |

**User-level `~/.abu/ABU.md`** is a new capability for cross-project rules (e.g. "use bilingual commit messages", "don't make large changes without a plan first").

**Project-level `{workspace}/.abu/ABU.md`** is recommended to commit to git so your team shares the same rules. Click **"Instructions · Click to add"** in the right panel to edit. Supports Markdown format.

**Modular rules**: For large projects, split rules into multiple `.md` files under `{workspace}/.abu/rules/` (e.g. `01-style.md`, `02-testing.md`, `03-deployment.md`). Abu loads them all alphabetically.

**Example project instructions**:

```markdown
## Overview
This is a React + Tailwind admin dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Build: Vite, run pnpm dev to start
- Testing: Vitest, run pnpm test

## Coding Standards
- Use function components + Hooks, no class components
- camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- Run pnpm lint before committing
```

### Memory Priority

When processing your requests, Abu injects context in this order:

```
User-level rules (~/.abu/ABU.md)
  → Project-level rules ({workspace}/.abu/ABU.md)
    → Modular rules ({workspace}/.abu/rules/*.md)
      → Project memory (auto-accumulated)
        → Personal memory (auto-accumulated)
```

Hand-written rules always take priority over auto-accumulated memory. If project-level and user-level rules conflict, project-level wins.

---

---

## MCP Protocol

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets Abu connect to external services and tools.

### What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that lets AI assistants call external tools through a standardized interface:

- Connect to **databases** for querying and analysis
- Integrate with **GitHub** for repo and issue management
- Use **search engines** for real-time information
- Connect to **Slack/messaging** for sending messages

### Adding MCP Servers

1. Open **Toolbox** → **MCP Tools** tab
2. Click **"Add MCP Server"**
3. Choose connection type:
   - **Stdio** — Local command-line tool (most common)
   - **HTTP** — Remote HTTP service
4. Enter server config (command, args, environment variables)
5. Click **"Connect"**

### Configuration Examples

**Filesystem server:**
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/dir"],
  "env": {}
}
```

**GitHub server:**
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
  }
}
```

### MCP Discovery

Ask Abu to search and install MCP servers for you:

```
Search for an MCP server that connects to Notion
```

---

## Scheduled Tasks

Let Abu automatically run recurring work on a schedule.

### Creating Tasks

**Method 1: Via conversation**

```
Every morning at 9 AM, search for the latest AI news and create a daily digest on my desktop
```

```
Every Monday at 10 AM, organize last week's meeting notes into a weekly report
```

**Method 2: Task panel**

1. Click **"Automation"** in the sidebar → **"Scheduled Tasks"** tab
2. Click **"Create Task"**
3. Set frequency (hourly / daily / weekly / custom)
4. Enter task description
5. Save

### Frequency Options

| Frequency | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Hourly | Runs every hour |
| Daily | Runs at a specified time each day |
| Weekly | Runs on a specified day and time each week |
| Custom | Custom interval |

### Managing Tasks

- **Pause/Resume** — Temporarily pause a task
- **Edit** — Modify description or frequency
- **Delete** — Permanently remove a task
- **View History** — See results of each execution

### Push to IM Channels

After a scheduled task completes, the result can be pushed to IM channels in addition to the desktop notification:

1. In the task editor, find **"Push to IM channel"** at the bottom
2. Pick a configured IM channel (set up in Settings → IM Channels first)
3. Fill in the push targets:
   - **Push to group** — group chat IDs (comma-separated for multiple)
   - **Push to user** — user IDs (comma-separated for multiple)

> At least one push target (group or user) is required, otherwise nothing will be pushed.

### Important Notes

- Scheduled tasks run in **unattended mode** — no confirmation dialogs
- Previously authorized paths/commands are auto-allowed; unauthorized sensitive operations are auto-skipped
- Desktop **notifications** are sent on completion; you can also push to IM channels
- Abu must be running for scheduled tasks to execute
- Tasks can be bound to a specific Skill so they run in that skill's context

---

## Triggers

Triggers are event-driven automation. When an external event happens, Abu automatically runs a preset task — no human in the loop.

### Trigger Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HTTP Receive** | Abu exposes a local HTTP endpoint; an external system can POST to trigger the task |
| **File Change** | Watch a file or directory for create/modify/delete events |
| **Cron / Interval** | Periodic execution at fixed intervals (in seconds) |
| **IM Message** | Listen to a configured IM channel and trigger when a message arrives |

### Creating a Trigger

**Method 1: Manual creation**

1. Click **"Automation"** in the sidebar → **"Triggers"** tab
2. Click **"New Trigger"**
3. Fill in the trigger configuration and save

**Method 2: Let Abu create it**

Click **"Let Abu create one"**, describe the trigger you need in natural language, and Abu will generate the config.

**Method 3: Templates**

Three preset templates are provided:
- **Alert SOP** — HTTP receive + keyword filter, ideal for alert handling
- **Log Monitor** — File watcher, good for log file analysis
- **Periodic Inspection** — Cron timer, good for recurring health checks

### Configuration

#### Basic

- **Name** (required) — must be unique
- **Description** (optional) — what this trigger does

#### Execution Instructions

The instructions Abu runs when the trigger fires. Use `$EVENT_DATA` to reference the event payload — Abu replaces it with the actual event content at runtime.

**Example:**

```
Received an alert: $EVENT_DATA
Analyze the alert content, judge severity, and provide handling suggestions.
```

#### Trigger Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **All events** | Every event triggers execution |
| **Keyword match** | Only triggers when the event data contains specific keywords (comma-separated for multiple) |
| **Regex match** | Only triggers when event data matches a regex |

You can also specify a **match field** to apply matching only to a specific JSON field of the event payload.

#### Debounce

When enabled, identical events within a configurable window (default 5 minutes) only trigger once — prevents duplicate execution.

#### Quiet Hours

When enabled, the trigger doesn't fire during a configured time range (e.g. 22:00 ~ 08:00) — avoids late-night disturbance.

#### File Change Configuration

When using "File Change":

- **Watch path** (required) — file or directory to watch
- **Event types** — pick one or more of create / modify / delete
- **File pattern** (optional) — glob pattern (e.g. `*.log`); only matching files trigger

#### Interval Configuration

When using "Interval":

- **Interval (seconds)** — minimum 10s, default 60s

#### IM Source Configuration

When using "IM Message":

- **Channel** — pick from configured IM channels
- **Listen scope** — mention-only / DM-only / all messages
- **Group ID** (optional) — only listen to a specific group
- **Sender filter** (optional) — only respond to specific user IDs

### Result Push

After a trigger executes, the result can be pushed to external destinations:

**Webhook push:**

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| D-Chat | D-Chat group bot webhook |
| Lark/Feishu | Lark custom bot webhook |
| DingTalk | DingTalk group bot webhook |
| WeCom | WeCom group bot webhook |
| Slack | Slack incoming webhook |
| HTTP | Custom HTTP endpoint (with headers) |

**IM channel push:** Select a configured IM channel and specify a group or DM target.

**Extract mode:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Last message | Only push Abu's final reply |
| Full conversation | Push the entire conversation transcript |
| Custom template | Use template variables to customize the push body |

### Managing Triggers

- **Enable/Disable** — toggle a trigger on or off
- **View endpoint** — for HTTP triggers, the POST endpoint URL is shown after saving
- **Execution history** — see status of every fire (running / completed / errored / filtered / debounced)
- **Delete** — remove triggers you don't need

### Permission Model

Triggers run unattended via a **four-tier capability system**:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Read-only** | Only file reads and web fetches; no modifications allowed |
| **Safe tools** | Can read/write workspace files and run safe commands (default) |
| **Full access** | All operations allowed (still subject to OS sandbox) |
| **Custom** | Fine-grained allowlist of commands, paths, and tools |

---

## IM Channels

IM Channels turn Abu into your team bot — just @Abu in your chat to interact.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Lark/Feishu** | ByteDance's Lark/Feishu (with WebSocket long connection support) |
| **DingTalk** | Alibaba's DingTalk |
| **WeCom** | Tencent's WeCom |
| **Slack** | Slack |
| **D-Chat** | D-Chat |

### Adding an IM Channel

1. Open **Settings** → **IM Channels**
2. Click **"Add channel"**
3. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Channel name** — display name (e.g. "Work Lark Bot")
   - **Platform** — select an IM platform
   - **App ID** — created in the IM platform's developer portal
   - **App Secret** — the corresponding secret
   - **Capability tier** — controls what operations Abu can perform
4. After saving, copy the displayed **Webhook URL**
5. Paste the Webhook URL into the IM platform's developer portal as the **event callback URL**
6. Toggle the channel switch to enable it

### Capability Tiers

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Chat-only** | Pure chat, no tool calls |
| **Read-only** | File reads and web fetches; no modifications |
| **Safe tools** | Read/write authorized files, run safe commands (default) |
| **Full access** | All operations (still subject to sandbox) |

### Session Management

| **Max turns** | Maximum dialogue turns per session | Configurable 1–500 |

### Access Control

Use the **Allowed users** list to control who can interact with Abu:

- Empty list = anyone can interact
- After adding user IDs, only listed users can use Abu

### Connection Status

Each channel shows a connection status indicator:

- 🟢 Green — Connected
- 🔴 Red — Connection error
- ⚫ Gray — Disconnected

---

## Browser Automation

Abu offers **two** browser automation paths — pick by use case:

| Path | Best for | Setup |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Abu-Browser** (recommended) | Daily web tasks (clicks/forms/screenshots/scraping) — lightweight, integrates with your everyday browser | Install the `Abu-Browser` skill; first use will guide you to **auto-install the Chrome extension** |
| **Webapp Testing** | End-to-end testing of local web apps with an isolated environment | Install the `webapp-testing` skill, uses Playwright |

### Using Abu-Browser (recommended)

1. Install the `Abu-Browser` skill from **Toolbox → Skills**
2. The first time you give Abu a browser-related task, it will guide you to **auto-install the Chrome extension**
3. After that, just describe what you want, e.g.:
   ```
   Open Wikipedia, search for "AI desktop assistants", and send me the first 5 result titles
   ```

> Abu-Browser uses a native bridge to talk to the Chrome extension, so it **drives the browser you actually use every day** — no extra Playwright browser overhead.

### Manually installing the Chrome extension (optional)

If you want to install from source manually:

1. **Install the Chrome Extension**
   - Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" → select the `abu-chrome-extension` directory

2. **Bridge Service**
   - Abu manages the Browser Bridge connection automatically

### Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Page Snapshot** | Get structured info about the current page |
| **Click Elements** | Click buttons, links, and other elements |
| **Fill Forms** | Auto-fill input fields, dropdowns, etc. |
| **Navigate** | Open URLs, go back/forward, switch tabs |
| **Screenshot** | Capture the current page |
| **Wait Conditions** | Wait for elements to appear/disappear, URL changes |
| **Run Scripts** | Execute JavaScript on the page |

### Examples

```
Open Google, search for "Abu AI assistant", and compile the top 5 results into a table
```

```
Open my GitHub repo, check for new Issues, and summarize them for me
```

---

## Computer Use

Let Abu directly control your computer — screenshot, click, type, scroll — like having someone help you operate the machine. Abu's Computer Use ships with multi-layered safeguards to prevent accidental control of sensitive apps or system-level dangerous keys.

### Enabling Computer Use

1. Open **Settings** → **Preferences**
2. Find **"Computer Use"** and toggle it on
3. On first enable, Abu will test screen recording permission

### System Permissions (macOS)

macOS requires two permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Path |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Screen Recording** | Screenshot capability | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording |
| **Accessibility** | Mouse/keyboard control | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility |

> Windows usually doesn't need extra permissions.

### Supported Operations

| Operation | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Screenshot** | Capture screen, with optional region | `x, y, width, height` (optional) |
| **Click** | Click at coordinates | `x, y`, button (left/right/middle/double) |
| **Move** | Move mouse to coordinates | `x, y` |
| **Scroll** | Scroll at coordinates | `x, y`, direction (up/down/left/right), magnitude |
| **Drag** | Drag from one point to another (with smooth animation) | start and end coordinates |
| **Type** | Type text (handles CJK input) | text content |
| **Press Key** | Press keyboard combo | key name + modifiers (ctrl/shift/alt/meta) |
| **Wait** | Wait for UI to settle | duration in ms (max 10s) |
| **Check Permissions** | Check macOS Screen Recording / Accessibility permission status | none |

### Safety Guards (important)

Abu's Computer Use is not a raw `enigo` call — it's wrapped in multiple guards in the Rust backend:

#### 1. Sensitive App Blocking

15+ apps are on a built-in blocklist. **When the active app is on the list, all mouse/keyboard operations are rejected**:

- **System-level**: Keychain Access, System Settings, Activity Monitor, Terminal, iTerm 2, Warp, VS Code (to prevent accidental code edits)
- **Communication/Meeting**: WeChat, Messages, Mail, Outlook, Slack, Lark, DingTalk, Discord, Zoom

> Want Abu to operate inside a blocked app? You'd need to manually allow it in settings (UI not yet exposed, planned).

#### 2. Dangerous Key Interception

The following key combos are rejected outright to prevent Abu from accidentally logging out or locking the screen:

- `Cmd+Q` / `Cmd+Shift+Q` (Quit / Logout)
- `Alt+Meta+Esc` (Force Quit dialog)
- `Cmd+Tab` (App switcher)
- `Ctrl+Meta+Q` (macOS lock screen)
- `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Empty trash)
- `Alt+F4` (Windows close window)
- `Ctrl+Alt+Delete` (Windows secure menu)
- `Meta+L` (Windows lock screen)
- `Alt+Tab` (Windows app switch)

Modifier names are normalized (`cmd→meta`, `control→ctrl`, `option→alt`) so spelling differences can't bypass the blocklist.

#### 3. Session-level Window Management

- When entering a Computer Use session, **the Abu main window and status overlay are hidden for the entire session** to avoid blocking the target UI
- On macOS, screenshots use `CGWindowListCreateImage` to exclude Abu's window and overlay — they **don't appear in screenshots without actually hiding the window**
- The session end automatically restores window visibility

#### 4. Session Timeout & Step Limit

| Limit | Default |
|-------|---------|
| **Max session duration** | 5 minutes |
| **Max steps per session** | 30 |

Exceeding either limit forces the session to end — prevents runaway loops or prolonged keyboard/mouse hijacking.

#### 5. Status Overlay + Global Stop Shortcut

- A semi-transparent **status overlay** at the screen edge shows the current step count and action in real time
- A configurable global keyboard shortcut stops the session at any time
- A **Stop button window** is also available at the screen edge during the session

### Examples

```
Open System Preferences and switch the wallpaper to dark mode
```

> ⚠️ This example will be blocked by sensitive-app blocking in the new version (System Settings is on the blocklist). For scenarios like this, manually open the target app first, then let Abu do the specific operations.

```
Open Finder and create a folder called "Work" on the desktop
```

```
Tidy up my desktop: drag all PDFs into ~/Documents/PDFs/
```

### How It Works

- Abu first takes a screenshot to "see" the current screen (auto-excludes Abu's own window)
- Locates the target element from the screenshot
- Executes click/type and **automatically takes another screenshot** to verify the result
- All coordinates are in the screenshot image space (max width 1280px) and auto-converted to actual screen coordinates
- Drags use a smooth animation to avoid being treated as "instant teleport" by some apps

### Notes

- Disabled by default; user must explicitly enable
- Sensitive app + dangerous key blocking lives in the Rust backend — **frontend cannot bypass**
- Screenshots are saved in the workspace directory (or desktop if no workspace)
- The 5-minute timeout is a hard cap and cannot be changed in the UI; for longer work, split into multiple sessions
- Can be disabled at any time in settings, takes effect immediately

## Image Generation

Abu can generate images from text descriptions.

### Two Ways to Use

#### Option 1: Built-in Provider Image Gen

If your provider supports built-in image generation (Bailian, Zhipu, OpenAI, SiliconFlow), a green ✅ badge appears in **AI Services** settings — use it directly.

#### Option 2: Configure Custom Image Gen

If your provider doesn't support built-in image generation:

1. In **AI Services** settings, find the "Image Generation" section
2. Expand **"Configure Custom Image Generation"**
3. Fill in the following:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **API Key** | Image generation API key (auto-reuses main API Key if using OpenAI provider) |
| **API URL** | Base URL for image generation (defaults to OpenAI if left blank) |
| **Model** | Choose `DALL-E 3`, `DALL-E 2`, or enter a custom model name |

### Image Generation Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `prompt` | Image description | (required) |
| `size` | Image dimensions | `1024x1024` (default), `1792x1024`, `1024x1792` |
| `style` | Visual style | `vivid` (default), `natural` |
| `save_path` | Save location | Auto-saves to workspace if omitted |

```

```
Create a wide banner image about "AI Shaping the Future", 1792x1024
```

## Sandbox & Security

Abu includes multiple layers of security to protect your system.

### OS-Level Sandbox

| Platform | Technology | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| macOS | Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) | Restricts file access for shell commands |
| Windows | PowerShell ConstrainedLanguage | Restricts script execution capabilities |

### Network Isolation

- **Domain whitelist** — Only allows access to whitelisted domains
- **Private network control** — Toggle access to local networks (127.0.0.1, 192.168.*, etc.)
- **Proxy mechanism** — Routes network traffic through a local proxy

### Path Protection

Abu will not access without permission:

- System directories (`/System`, `/usr`, `C:\Windows`, etc.)
- Other users' directories
- Sensitive config files (SSH keys, browser data, etc.)

### Command Safety

- Dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`) are automatically blocked
- First-time commands require user confirmation
- Authorized commands can be auto-allowed

### Configuring the Sandbox

1. Open **Settings** → **Security**
2. Toggle **Sandbox Protection** on/off
3. Toggle **Network Isolation** on/off
4. Manage the **domain whitelist**

## Behavior Awareness

Behavior Awareness lets Abu understand your work patterns so it can give context-aware answers.

### How It Works

- Samples the **active window's title** (e.g. Chrome, VS Code) every 5 minutes
- Data is retained for 7 days, then auto-cleaned
- Aggregated into a 3–5 line summary that's injected into the conversation context

**Example injection:**
```
- Today: Chrome 1.5h, Xcode 45min, Terminal 30min
- Current: Using Xcode
- Common hours: 9-12, 14-18
```

### Enabling It

1. Open **Settings** → **Preferences**
2. Find **"Behavior Awareness"** and toggle it on
3. macOS first-time enable requires **Automation** permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation, allow Abu to control "System Events")

### Privacy Protections

| Protection | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Off by default** | User must explicitly enable |
| **Window title only** | Doesn't record screen content or screenshots |
| **Raw data stays local** | Only the aggregated summary is sent to the AI; raw logs are never sent |
| **Clearable anytime** | Once enabled, the settings page shows a "Clear Behavior Data" button |

### Storage

- Storage path: `~/.abu/behavior-log.json`
- Retention: 7 days

## FAQ

### Q: Does Abu upload my data?

No. Abu is a local-first app — your files and data are processed locally. The only network traffic is API requests to your LLM provider.

### Q: Where is my API Key stored?

API Keys are stored in your local app data directory. They are never uploaded to any server.

### Q: Where is my memory and where are my project rules stored?

- **Personal memory**: `~/.abu/memory/` multi-file directory, each entry is a separate `.md` file
- **Project memory**: `~/.abu/projects/<workspace-key>/memory/`, auto-isolated per workspace
- **User-level rules**: `~/.abu/ABU.md` (hand-written)
- **Project-level rules**: `{workspace}/.abu/ABU.md` (hand-written, recommended to commit to git)
- **Modular rules**: `{workspace}/.abu/rules/*.md` (loaded alphabetically, max 20 files)

Legacy locations (`~/.abu/agents/abu/memory.md` and `{workspace}/.abu/MEMORY.md`) are **automatically migrated** the first time you launch the new version — no manual action needed.

### Q: Can I use multiple models at once?

Currently only one model config can be active at a time. You can switch between providers and models in settings at any time.

### Q: Scheduled tasks aren't running?

- Make sure Abu is running (the app must stay open)
- Check if the task is in "Paused" state
- Check the task execution history for error messages

### Q: How do I create custom Skills?

Say "Help me create a new skill" in conversation. Abu will guide you through the process. Skills are stored as Markdown files in `builtin-skills/` and can be edited directly.

### Q: MCP server won't connect?

- Verify the server command and arguments are correct
- Check that required runtimes are installed (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Verify environment variables are correctly configured
- For HTTP servers, confirm the URL is accessible

### Q: How do I use browser automation?

The easiest way is to install the **Abu-Browser** skill — on first use, Abu will guide you through auto-installing the Chrome extension. Then just describe what you want to do in the browser.

### Q: How can the trigger HTTP endpoint be reached from outside?

Trigger HTTP endpoints listen on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) by default. To reach them from external systems, use a tunneling tool (e.g. ngrok) or run Abu on a server with a reachable address.

### Q: I configured an IM channel but I'm not receiving messages?

- Verify the Webhook URL is correctly set in the IM platform's developer portal
- Verify the IM platform can reach your Webhook (you may need a tunnel for local development)
- Verify the channel toggle is on
- Check if access control allowlist is restricting users

### Q: Computer Use says insufficient permissions?

On macOS, grant **Screen Recording** and **Accessibility** to Abu in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, then restart Abu.

### Q: Does Behavior Awareness leak my privacy?

No. Behavior Awareness only records window titles (e.g. app names), not screen content or screenshots. Raw data stays local; only the aggregated summary is injected into the conversation context. You can disable it and clear data at any time in Settings.

### Q: What languages are supported?

Abu's UI supports **Simplified Chinese** and **English**. Switch in Settings, or set to "Follow System" for automatic detection.
